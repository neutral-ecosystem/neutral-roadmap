# Neutral language v0 requirements

Status: proposed v0 requirements

This is the canonical language-level requirements contract for Neutral v0. It
merges the former needed-features, syntax checklist, architectural choices, and
language showcase into one reviewable source. It contains only features needed
to prove the first source-to-IR boundary and does not define later language
versions or application runtime behavior.

## 1. Product outcome

v0 must prove this complete path:

```text
one captured .neu source unit
    -> parser and semantic analysis
    -> immutable Neutral IR
    -> public reader API
    -> generic effect-free probe
```

- **NL-V0-001:** The probe must enumerate declarations, types, values,
  `Ref<T>` edges, vocabulary-owned values, and provenance without parsing
  source or using compiler-private models.
- **NL-V0-002:** A probe diagnostic must map from an IR element to the correct
  captured source span.
- **NL-V0-003:** v0 must assign no application-specific meaning or perform an
  external effect.

## 2. Representation boundaries

- **NL-BND-001:** Concrete `.neu` syntax, compiler-private frontend/semantic
  models, public Neutral IR, and consumer-private data are distinct layers.
- **NL-BND-002:** Consumers receive only documented public IR/reader contracts.
- **NL-BND-003:** Every accepted source construct must have documented lowering
  or explicitly non-semantic source-map treatment.
- **NL-BND-004:** Successful compilation means structural validity, not
  authorization, execution, external compatibility, or proof of an effect.
- **NL-BND-005:** v0 has no public IR transformation API.

## 3. Captured compilation

- **NL-CAP-001:** A v0 request contains exactly one source unit and one logical
  module.
- **NL-CAP-002:** The host supplies the only resolver used by compilation.
- **NL-CAP-003:** `capture(request)` produces an immutable
  `CapturedCompilation`; `compileCaptured(...)` performs no external I/O.
- **NL-CAP-004:** The captured form includes exact source bytes, logical and
  content identities, optional exact vocabulary bytes/identity, behavior
  versions, options, and deterministic budgets.
- **NL-CAP-005:** Missing captured inputs fail closed. Source triggers no
  ambient filesystem, environment, or network lookup.
- **NL-CAP-006:** Resolver credentials and host paths do not enter source, IR,
  ordinary diagnostics, or derivation.

## 4. Source text and grammar

- **NL-SRC-001:** Source is UTF-8. Invalid UTF-8 and unescaped NUL are errors.
- **NL-SRC-002:** Original bytes define source identity and byte spans; line
  endings normalize logically without changing original offsets.
- **NL-SRC-003:** `//` starts a line comment and `/* ... */` is a non-nesting
  block comment.
- **NL-SRC-004:** Declarations end by logical newline or a closing declaration
  block; v0 has no semicolon token.
- **NL-SRC-005:** The private frontend is raw lexer → layout normalizer →
  parser, with deterministic recovery boundaries.
- **NL-SRC-006:** Identifiers are ASCII. Bindings, fields, and modules use
  `snake_case`; type and vocabulary names are uppercase-leading, with
  `UpperCamelCase` as style.
- **NL-SRC-007:** `::` is reserved for vocabulary qualification in v0. General
  `.` member access and vocabulary static selection are absent.

## 5. Document shape

- **NL-DOC-001:** Every unit begins with canonical `neu "0.1"` followed by one
  canonical `module snake_case` header.
- **NL-DOC-002:** Zero or one `use Vocabulary` declaration appears after the
  headers and before ordinary declarations.
- **NL-DOC-003:** `use` names a logical vocabulary requirement only; captured
  lock data selects one exact permitted bundle.
- **NL-DOC-004:** The root contains record and binding declarations only.
- **NL-DOC-005:** All valid declarations are exported. v0 has no visibility
  modifier, namespace declaration, module import, or multi-unit merge.

## 6. Declarations and names

- **NL-DEC-001:** Bindings use immutable type-first syntax without `let`:
  `num count = 10`.
- **NL-DEC-002:** Every binding has an explicit type. Context may determine the
  type of an inner record/list literal, but not a declaration.
- **NL-DEC-003:** v0 has no `mut`, reassignment, assignment statement, override,
  or mutation method.
- **NL-DEC-004:** Declarations are collected before value/reference resolution,
  so declaration order is non-semantic.
- **NL-DEC-005:** Ordinary value uses may refer forward. Static value-dependency
  cycles are errors.
- **NL-DEC-006:** `ref(name)` may refer forward and does not participate in the
  value-dependency cycle graph.
- **NL-DEC-007:** Duplicate names are invalid. Core names cannot be redeclared.

## 7. Core types

- **NL-TYP-001:** The scalar types are exactly `num`, `string`, and `bool`.
- **NL-TYP-002:** `num` is an exact normalized base-10 rational in Neutral IR;
  it has no host-dependent integer/float split or v0 target conversion.
- **NL-TYP-003:** `T?` adds `null` to a type. `null` is the only explicit null
  literal and there is no `absent`/`none` value.
- **NL-TYP-004:** `List<T>` is ordered and homogeneous.
- **NL-TYP-005:** `Ref<T>` is a typed document-local identity reference.
- **NL-TYP-006:** User records are nominal. Every recursive record cycle is
  invalid unless the cycle crosses `Ref<T>`.
- **NL-TYP-007:** Compatibility is exact type identity plus outer `T` to `T?`
  widening. Generic arguments are invariant.
- **NL-TYP-008:** v0 has no maps, sets, tuples, unions, enums, user-defined
  generics, or implicit conversions other than the stated nullability widening.

## 8. Records, lists, defaults, and values

- **NL-VAL-001:** A record declaration contains typed fields with unique
  `snake_case` names.
- **NL-VAL-002:** Contextual `{ ... }` construction requires exactly one
  expected nominal type and explicit `field: value` entries.
- **NL-VAL-003:** Field shorthand and untyped anonymous records are absent.
- **NL-VAL-004:** `[...]` constructs an ordered homogeneous list; an empty list
  requires an expected `List<T>` type.
- **NL-VAL-005:** A field without a default is required. A field with a closed
  constant default may be omitted.
- **NL-VAL-006:** Required/defaulted and nullable/non-nullable are independent:
  `string name`, `string? note`, `string name = "x"`, and
  `string? note = null` have distinct contracts.
- **NL-VAL-007:** Defaults may contain only literals, `null` where nullable,
  lists, and contextual records composed from closed constants.
- **NL-VAL-008:** An ordinary binding name reuses its immutable logical value.
  Logical IR stores the resulting value; provenance stores the reuse edge.

## 9. Identity references

- **NL-REF-001:** Only `ref(name)` constructs `Ref<T>`.
- **NL-REF-002:** The target must be a value binding of compatible type; types,
  modules, and vocabulary namespaces are wrong-kind targets.
- **NL-REF-003:** `Ref<T>` means identity only. It implies no containment,
  ownership, ordering, dependency, readiness, or runtime behavior.
- **NL-REF-004:** IR targets use graph-local `ElementId`. Logical equality and
  determinism are defined modulo consistent `ElementId` renaming.
- **NL-REF-005:** Consumers cannot treat `ElementId` as durable cross-document
  identity.

## 10. Minimal vocabulary boundary

- **NL-VOC-001:** v0 supports zero or one exact captured data-only vocabulary.
- **NL-VOC-002:** A vocabulary may define nominal types, fields, closed constant
  defaults, and required structural feature IDs.
- **NL-VOC-003:** Vocabulary types use `Vocabulary::Type`; this does not add a
  special declaration kind to core grammar.
- **NL-VOC-004:** Bundles conform to one closed, versioned, Neutral-owned schema
  and contain no scripts, callbacks, arbitrary expressions, custom validators,
  bytecode, or native modules.
- **NL-VOC-005:** Published schema/feature IDs have immutable meaning. Unknown
  required structural semantics fail closed.
- **NL-VOC-006:** The compiler validates payload structure. A generic probe only
  enumerates vocabulary-owned data and does not interpret application behavior.
- **NL-VOC-007:** The external reader receives exact captured vocabulary
  contracts from its host and performs no hidden acquisition.

## 11. IR and identity

- **NL-IR-001:** Logical payload and artifact envelope are separate projections.
- **NL-IR-002:** The payload contains versions, logical module/vocabulary
  identities, required features, declarations, types, final values, and
  reference edges.
- **NL-IR-003:** Producer/build, encoding, integrity, source-map, provenance, and
  derivation facts live in the envelope or companion artifacts and do not alter
  logical equality.
- **NL-IR-004:** Logical module identity, captured source/bundle content
  identity, module-symbol identity, declaration fingerprint, graph-local element
  ID, derivation identity, and byte identity are distinct.
- **NL-IR-005:** Logical equality is graph alpha-equivalence under one-to-one
  element-ID mapping.
- **NL-IR-006:** Successful compiler output is immutable and already validated.
  External encoded IR is always decoded and validated as untrusted input.

## 12. Source maps, provenance, and derivation

- **NL-PRO-001:** Source maps associate IR element IDs with half-open original
  byte spans.
- **NL-PRO-002:** Provenance records why a value exists: explicit source,
  ordinary reuse, record default, or vocabulary default.
- **NL-PRO-003:** Provenance references source-map entries rather than copying
  spans.
- **NL-PRO-004:** Derivation separates meaning-affecting inputs,
  acceptance/resource inputs, and diagnostic/output-policy inputs.
- **NL-PRO-005:** Formatting-only changes may preserve logical IR while changing
  source maps. A semantic cache cannot reuse stale locations.

## 13. APIs

- **NL-API-001:** Public operations include `capture`, `compileCaptured`, the
  convenience `compile`, and `decodeAndValidate`.
- **NL-API-002:** Compilation returns authoritative IR only on success, plus
  diagnostics, source map, provenance, derivation, and resource facts.
- **NL-API-003:** The reader exposes immutable typed traversal and indexed lookup
  without exposing storage layout as meaning.
- **NL-API-004:** APIs are reentrant, concurrency-safe, cancellable, and bounded.
- **NL-API-005:** v0 exposes no public AST and no IR rewrite/transformation API.

## 14. Diagnostics and robustness

- **NL-DIA-001:** Diagnostics have stable codes, layer, severity, safe
  parameters, primary/related spans, optional remedy, and truncation state.
- **NL-DIA-002:** Canonical ordering uses logical source-unit identity, byte
  range, code, then safe parameters.
- **NL-DIA-003:** Recovery never converts invalid source into authoritative IR.
- **NL-DIA-004:** Compiler and reader enforce explicit bounds on bytes, nesting,
  declarations, references, list size, numeric digits/scale, diagnostics, and IR
  size before proportional work.
- **NL-DIA-005:** Operational time/memory ceilings are deployment controls, not
  reproducible language semantics.
- **NL-DIA-006:** Diagnostics escape control text and never expose accidental
  host paths or acquisition credentials.

## 15. Required v0 documentation and evidence

v0 requires:

1. normative lexical, layout, grammar, name, type, value, reference, and
   vocabulary specifications;
2. a logical IR and one noncanonical encoding specification;
3. identity, source-map, provenance, and derivation specifications;
4. compiler, resolver, reader, and probe API specifications;
5. positive, negative, ambiguity, exact-numeric, vocabulary, resource, and adversarial
   fixtures;
6. deterministic repeated/concurrent compilation tests; and
7. one generic effect-free public-API probe.

## 16. Explicit v0 non-features

The following are outside v0 and are not implied future commitments:

- namespaces and visibility modifiers;
- multiple source units and imports;
- secret references;
- static/member selection;
- symbolic operators and expressions;
- functions and control structures;
- mutation and override;
- composition, templates, macros, and expansion;
- general-purpose collections beyond `List<T>`;
- executable plugins;
- ambient or runtime effects;
- IR transformation and migration APIs;
- canonical encoding; and
- application-specific syntax, types, or behavior.

## 17. Merged syntax acceptance profile

The syntax checklist is normative through the requirements above. This matrix
keeps every syntax family from the former `syntax.md` checklist traceable to a
stable requirement area and its required evidence.

| Syntax family | Requirement coverage | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Governing boundaries | NL-V0, NL-BND | source/AST/IR/probe separation and lowering records |
| Lexical source text and layout | NL-SRC | UTF-8, bytes, comments, newline, identifier, delimiter, and literal fixtures |
| Document headers and module shape | NL-CAP, NL-DOC | exact `neu "0.1"`, one module, one source unit, header diagnostics |
| Declarations and names | NL-DEC | immutable type-first bindings, duplicate/core-name, forward-use, and cycle cases |
| Types and records | NL-TYP, NL-VAL | nominal records, typed fields, recursion, nullability, and list compatibility cases |
| Values and defaults | NL-VAL | contextual records, homogeneous lists, empty lists, explicit values, and closed defaults |
| Identity references | NL-REF | `ref(name)`, wrong-kind targets, forward references, and identity-only semantics |
| Vocabulary surface | NL-VOC | captured bundle identity, qualified types, payload validation, and fail-closed cases |
| Diagnostics and recovery | NL-DIA | stable codes, spans, ordering, limits, recovery boundaries, and truncation |
| Formatting and evolution | NL-SRC, NL-BND, NL-IR | deterministic formatter, token boundaries, source-map/provenance conformance |

No syntax is accepted merely because a parser can recognize it. Every accepted
form needs normative semantics, lowering or non-semantic treatment, invalid
examples, diagnostics, and public-reader evidence.

## 18. Merged architectural choices

The former `choices.md` decisions are binding requirements for v0:

| Choice | Required consequence |
| --- | --- |
| C1: prove one complete source-to-IR journey | A generic effect-free probe must consume the public reader API and map diagnostics to source. |
| C2: one source unit and exported module | Exactly one `module` is accepted and every valid declaration is exported. |
| C3: closed core plus one captured vocabulary | Core syntax remains small; at most one data-only, host-captured vocabulary is allowed. |
| C4: immutable values and identity references | Names reuse values; `ref(name)` creates identity edges; mutation and override are absent. |
| C5: capture before pure compilation | `compileCaptured` performs no external I/O and is replayable. |
| C6: logical payload and companion artifacts | IR meaning, encoding, source maps, provenance, and derivation remain separate projections. |
| C7: graph-local identity and alpha-equivalence | `ElementId` is not durable identity; equality is modulo consistent renaming. |
| C8: untrusted reader with host contracts | External IR and vocabulary input are validated before typed views are exposed. |
| C9: explicit deterministic limits | Byte, nesting, declaration, list, reference, numeric, diagnostic, and IR budgets are public. |
| C10: defer unproven surface area | Unsupported features fail visibly and require a new need, decision, and evidence set. |

## 19. Merged showcase conformance

The following source is the minimum complete v0 journey. It exercises the
headers, vocabulary boundary, records, defaults, scalars, lists, nullability,
value reuse, identity references, and exact numeric values in one module:

```neu
neu "0.1"
module showcase

use Fixture

record Config {
    string image,
    string? note = null,
    List<string> labels = [],
}

record Selection {
    Ref<Config> config,
}

string image = "example.invalid/tool:1"
string copied_image = image
bool enabled = true
num ratio = 0.5

Config config = {
    image: copied_image,
    labels: ["portable", "typed"],
}

Selection selection = {
    config: ref(config),
}

Fixture::Metadata metadata = {
    label: "generic probe",
}
```

The implementation must also prove the showcase’s invalid boundaries: missing
required fields, heterogeneous lists, non-nullable `null`, incompatible types,
value cycles, embedded recursive records, wrong-kind references, `.` selection,
multiple modules, and unavailable vocabulary contracts.

## 20. Requirement authority and maintenance

This file is the language-level authority for v0 requirements. The v0 decision,
development, fixture, and portable documents provide more specific evidence and
operational detail but must not contradict it. The former source documents are
retained under `neutral-lang/_docs/merged/` as review history after this merge.

When a requirement changes, update its evidence references and the v0 roadmap in
the same change. A feature is not part of v0 until its requirement, semantics,
invalidity, lowering, diagnostics, resource behavior, and conformance evidence
are all present.
