# Neutral language v0 decisions

Status: proposed coherent baseline

These decisions specify only the minimum v0 language described by
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md). They do not plan later versions.
Implementation order and release gates are defined in
[the v0 roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).

## Complete v0 surface

```text
neu "0.1"
module example
[use Vocabulary]

record Name { ... }
Type binding = value
```

Core types are `num`, `string`, `bool`, `T?`, `List<T>`, `Ref<T>`, user
records, and qualified vocabulary types. Values are scalar/null literals,
contextual records, lists, ordinary binding reuse, and `ref(name)`.

Every binding is immutable and explicitly typed. One source unit defines one
module; all declarations are exported.

## Excluded from v0

v0 has no namespace or visibility syntax, multiple units, imports, secrets,
static/member selection, operators, functions, control structures, mutation,
composition, templates, macros, executable plugins, external effects, or
application-specific declarations.

An excluded feature requires a later independent proposal; these files make no
promise that it will be added.
